# Supervision

- Change presentation
  - "... modelled **over**" instead of what we have at the moment.
  - Add a proof rule for the example to the presentation. This can then be used to describe how proofs are done using SC.
  - Representative rules for SC.
- Make use of libraries or some tools for generating the tools.
- Be aware of ¬A ∨ B ≠ A → B in constructive logic nor linear logic.
- Possible properties of difficulty:
  - Gather data about:
    - solution times
    - # of steps
- Maybe introduce "weakening" operations to reduce noise of the proofs.
