# Tenjin: Paper Prototype User Test

### 0. Ask them how they perform the actions
1. Show them how a split may look like. 
_How do you separate these planets?_ 
**Tell them what happens after they have split the force field.** (Nothing, they can continue to solve the puzzle.)
2. Show them how a case may look like (the rotation of two bodies). 
_How do you separate these planets?_ 
**Tell them what happens after they separated the bodies from the orbit.** (Each body will be focused on, respectively, and they can continue to solve the puzzle.)
3. Show them how negation may look like (a black hole behind a body).
_How do you move this body to the other side of the rift?_
**Tell them what happens when they have moved the body to the other side of the rift**. (The body is on the other side of the rift, and they can continue to solve the puzzle.)

### 1. Hold their hands to solve the simple proof 
$$
  Γ, A, (¬A ∨ B) ⸠ B, Δ
$$

1. Split A and (¬A ∨ B). _(The planets are separated and the force field disappears.)_
2. Separate (¬A ∨ B) from their orbit. _(¬A is focused on, B is moved out of focus.)_

3. Move ¬A to the other side of the rift through the black hole. _(A pops in the black hole and appears on the other side.)_

4. Tap A on both sides of the rift to repair the rift (proving the statements). _(The planets representing A disappear, and we are left with B. The B out of focus moves back in focus.)_

5. Same as (4). _(The user is finished and has proved the statement. They finished the level!).

### 2. Present a more challenging proof and ask them to solve it 
$$
  Γ, (A ∨ B) ∧ C, ¬B ∨ C ⸠ B ∨ C, Δ
$$
