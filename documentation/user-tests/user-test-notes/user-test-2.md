# First paper-prototype user test
## Subject information
24 year-old male, studying Computer Science at Chalmers.
## Planet pairs, rotating and force fields
The subject expressed that it would drag one planet at a time when they are in a force field.

In the case of a rotation, the subject expressed that the it would use a long-press way of separating.

## Negation - moving with black holes
The subject expressed that it would make use of the black hole to move across. Extra emphasis was put on that the black hole should not consume a planet unless it's put directly into it.

## Proof introduction
The subject responded well to the first introduction of the proof. Splitting the rotation was obvious and easy for the subject to understand. The black hole was well understood and used properly.

## Solve a proof independently
The subject wanted to instantly move a planet with a black hole even thought it was in a rotation which is not possible. With a bit of guidance, the rotation was split and the rest of the proof proceeded without error.

## Takeaways
The location of the black hole should be such that one does not accidently use it.

Maybe there is a way of making it more obvious when certain operations can be made.
