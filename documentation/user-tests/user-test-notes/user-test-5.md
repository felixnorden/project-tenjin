# First paper-prototype user test
## Subject information
13 year-old male, studying in compulsary school.
## Planet pairs, rotating and force fields
The subject expressed that it would double tap a force field to remove it.

The rotation was handled by pinning down the rotating planets. A long press basically.

## Negation - moving with black holes
The subject proposed a drag and drop motion, dropping the planet into its corresponding black hole. 

_The goal was shown that the subject had to press on matching planets of each side of the rift before the proof introduction. The three rules were reinstated so that the subject could remember what actions were allowed._
## Proof introduction
The subject tried to move the planet into the black hole behind it, but the "computer" didn't allow that action. They then chose to stop the rotation of the two bodies, letting them to focus on each planet and completing the level. They easily caught on. 

## Solve a proof independently
They managed to solve the problem very well, but seemed to believe that they needed to tap on all of the matching planets to finish the level. Additionally, they tried to stop the rotation of two bodies inside an enclosing force field, which is not allowed.

## Takeaways
- Double-tap to remove force fields.
- Long press to stop rotation.
- Drag and drop to use the black hole.
- The subject believed you have to tap on all matching planets to finish the level. 
- The order of the operations were not clear, perhaps this is due to the paper prototype not clearly showing it in size differences. 
- They expressed the game was easy, and intuitive, especially when the rules were established.
