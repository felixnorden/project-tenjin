# First paper-prototype user test
## Subject information
14 year-old male, studying at upper secondary school.

## Planet pairs, rotating and force fields
The subject expressed that the easiest way to handle a force field was to drag out each of the planets one by one.

This was also the subject's way to go for the case of a rotation, pinning down the planets and dragging them away.

## Negation - moving with black holes
The subject expressed that it would use a black hole by tapping the planet and then the black hole that belongs to it to move the planet to the other side.

## Proof introduction
The subject responded well to the first introduction of the proof. Splitting the rotation was obvious and easy for the subject to understand. The black hole was well understood and used properly.

## Solve a proof independently
The subject made an error trying to verify with a planet that was still in a force field. After getting a hint, the problem was solved without any more errors.

## Takeaways
The tap action for the usage of a black hole might be of interest.

Dragging as a way of splitting force fields and rotations.
