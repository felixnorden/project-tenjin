# First paper-prototype user test
## Subject information
21 year-old female, studying teaching for children between 9-12 y/o at GU.
## Planet pairs, rotating and force fields
The subject felt double tapping should remove the force field.

Interestingly, the subject wished to pin down all of the rotating bodies, saying that it could be seen as a difficulty for the game.

## Negation - moving with black holes
They dragged the planet into the center of the black hole.

_The goal was shown that the subject had to press on matching planets of each side of the rift before the proof introduction. The three rules were reinstated so that the subject could remember what actions were allowed._
## Proof introduction
The subject initially had trouble following the rules, and felt there were too much to keep track at once. Since there was A, ¬A on the same side, they didn't think it was necessary to move ¬A to the other side of the rift. Instead, they opted to drag ¬A next to A, and thought it was enough. They were told they could not do that, and then it became clearer.

## Solve a proof independently
They tried to stop the rotation of two bodies before removing the force field. However, after being told they could not do that, they managed to solve the problem relatively easily.

## Takeaways
- Double-tap to remove force fields.
- Hold down all of the planets to stop the rotation.
- Drag and drop to use the black hole.
- They explicitly wished for a menu showing the available rules, and some sort of feedback as the amount of points they can get, or a timer, to increase the difficulty-level.
- The order of actions were not clear either.
