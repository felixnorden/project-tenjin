# First paper-prototype user test
## Subject information
23 year-old female, studying Pharmacy at GU.
## Planet pairs, rotating and force fields
The subject expressed that it would double tap a force field to remove it.

The rotation was handled by pinning down the rotating planets, moving them away from each other.

## Negation - moving with black holes
The subject proposed a drag motion, swiping the planet into its corresponding black hole. 

## Proof introduction
After first trying to use a black hole, the subject was given a hint to split the rotation before. Splitting the rotation was an easy step for the subject to understand. The black hole was well understood and used properly.

## Solve a proof independently
The subject managed to complete the proof on its own with no errors. The subject mentioned that it felt intuitive and quite easy to complete the proof, which was the goal.

## Takeaways
Double tapping for splitting rotations and/ or force fields.
