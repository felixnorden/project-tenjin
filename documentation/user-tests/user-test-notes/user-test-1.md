# First paper-prototype user test
## Subject information
24 year-old female, studying English at GU.

## Planet pairs, rotating and force fields
The subject expressed that reverse pinching was the most obvious way of splitting in both the cases.

## Negation - moving with black holes
The subject expressed that a drag movement is the most obvious choice here. Moving the planet straight through from one side to the other was the first choice but after getting introduced to the black hole, the subject expressed that it was a good way of doing it as well.

## Proof introduction
The subject responded well to the first introduction of the proof. Splitting conjunctions and disjunctions was obvious and easy for the subject to understand but there was some confusion regarding the black hole and how it works. It was further explained to make it a bit clearer.

## Solve a proof independently
The subject felt a bit confused as it did not know where to start. It started with a split, which turned out to be a good choice as it validated a part of the proof just by that action. The subject managed to complete the proof on its own with no errors. The subject mentioned that it felt intuitive and quite easy to complete the proof, which was the goal.

## Takeaways
Moving directly from one side to the other using a drag movement for negation was the subject's first choice, instead of going in to a black hole. 

The subject thought that the black hole was confusing at first.

Maybe there is a way to make it more obvious as to what to start with in a problem.
