# Diary Week 12

This week went better than the week before. A considerable amount was done: the game-module is as good as finished. The tree library for the code has been put on hold for so long. More has been written on the report (mostly theory). The UI has been worked on more, the elements have been drafted and converted into vector graphics and added as assets.

## Work tasks

- Update UML class diagram for the implementation and add necessary classes.
- Connect logic module to Unity frontend.
- Continue writing on report, with the focus on the following chapters:
  - Background
  - Theory
  - Method
  - Result
- Write Tree library

### Finished tasks

- UML class diagram was updated, but it needs to be continuously updated
- Continue writing on report, with a focus on these chapters:
  - Theory
- (Not in the original plan, but assets have been created and more will be created)

### Unfinished tasks

- The other parts of the report:
  - Background
  - Method
  - Result
- Connect the logic module to a Unity frontend.

## Problems

- Importing our core project into Unity seems to be more difficult than we first thought.

### Suggested solutions (with reflections)

For the dependency of our core project

- Read through the documentation of Unity to see what is needed for the compilation of a dependency for it to work.

#### Solution (if chosen)

- Read through the docs for Unity.
