# Diary Week 13

This week went a bit worse than the previous one. The primary reason for this was that easter break came in the middle of the week, and some members had other plans over this holiday. We also had a lot of problems with Unity not fully working one members' computer. In general, more work has been done on the report (mainly proof reading and giving feedback/suggestions to each other), as well as some more work in Unity and the graphics.

## Work tasks

- Update UML class diagram for the implementation and add necessary classes.
- Connect logic module to Unity frontend.
  - Be prepared for errors
- Continue writing on report, with the focus on the following chapters:
  - Background
  - Theory
    - C\#
  - Method
    - Logic Module
  - Result
  - Proof-read report
  - Check out other reports within IT to get a better feeling of how the report should be like
- Add more assets
- Refactor logic module

### Finished tasks

## Problems

As mentioned above, our main issue has been getting Unity to fully work with every member's computer. The the issue occurred due to Unity having troubles resolving what .NET framework version were installed on some computers, resulting in incorrect dependencies which wouldn't allow neither editor nor compiler to function. We resolved the issue by renaming the installed framework folders to the ones that Unity depended upon.
