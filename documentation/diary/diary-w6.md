## Problems

Not being able to work in parallell, since much of the work done still needs group discussions, is currently a bottleneck in the project. 

### Suggested solutions (with reflections)

We will try to differentiate between tasks that needs group discussions, and tasks that could be done in isolation.

#### Solution (if chosen)

The suggested solution will be implemented and  tested during next weeks sprint.
