# Diary Week 16

This week, we did not have a planning meeting as all of us knew what had to be done. The primary focus was to continue on with the thesis and the secondary focus was to continue on working with Unity in the frontend.

We have also decided not to have any meeting during the next week, as the only focus will be to finish up the thesis for the deadline on the 16th of May.

## Problems

The only problem we have is that we still haven't heard anything from our supervisor regarding the first thesis draft, and the deadline is in 4 days... We have tried to come in contact with him on several occasions, but still haven't gotten a reply.

### Suggested solutions (with reflections)

We don't really have a solution, except for continuing with trying to get into contact with him. The problem is that we haven't heard anything from him regarding the thesis draft at the time of writing this (May 14th).
