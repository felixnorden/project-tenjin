# Diary 4

## Work tasks

In this section, the tasks that the team has decided on for the week are presented. Each of the listed tasks will be then be present under "Finished tasks" or "Unfinished tasks".

### Finished tasks

- Project planning report
- Check with Andreas Abel regarding project planning report - No answer

### Unfinished tasks

- Natural deduction or Sequent calculus? (Bad logic joke...) Both?
- Decide on game engine/development framework

## Problems

We are still having a bit of difficulty finding an appropriate visualisation for both Natural Deduction and Sequent Calculus.

A prior problem that still exists is the choice of either Natural Deduction or Sequent Calculus.

### Suggested solutions (with refl  ections)

The solution to both of these problems seem to be that we need to sit down and discuss the pros and cons with both Natural Deduction and Sequent Calculus. From then on, the best thing would be to find the minimal required operators to represent all formal statements and then try to visualise just these operators. Then, if we find something more to extend the language with, we can do that in the future.

#### Solution (if chosen)

The solution above is the only one that has been specified and the one we choose to go forward with in the future.
