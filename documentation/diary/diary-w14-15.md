# Diary Week 14 and 15

This sprint dragged out for a bit more than originally planned. We initially thought of having the sprint until May 1st, but it dragged on until May 5th instead. Partly beacuse the report really took its toll on the team, partly because the majority of the team also had 4 other deadlines coming up.

## Problems

The main problem which we faced was the lack of time, or not being efficient enough. We still haven't gotten to getting a frontend going in Unity (which we need for the exhibition), and there are still major parts missing in the thesis. Hopefully, we can get more of the development done in parallel with thesis writing and prepping the poster for the exhibition on the 21st.

### Suggested solutions (with reflections)

As mentioned above, the suggested solution is to simply split the team to work more in parallel with both the thesis and with Unity, so that we can get a functioning prototype for the exhibition. The poster will also be done by the Unity team, so that the thesis team can get back on track.

#### Solution (if chosen)

The solution mentioned above.
