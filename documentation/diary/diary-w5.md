## Problems

Project-wise there aren't really any problems at the moment. However, we are having trouble with getting in touch with our supervisor as they aren't responding to neither Slack or email.

### Suggested solutions (with reflections)

Visit our supervisor in his office.

We shall try to visit our supervisor's office when we have the time available this week.
