# Diary Week 3

This week, the workload has been a bit on the lighter side due to three out of four people of the team having a heavier workload from the two other courses.

## Work tasks

- Create 3 propositional statements that are diverse, and include the different operators.
  - One simple statement, involving some form of elimination rule.
  - One intermediate statement, including at least one ∨-operator.
  - One intermediate/advanced statement, including at least one introduction rule and both ¬- and ⟶-operators.
- Solve these statements and mirror the solutions with the mentioned visualisation, and see if they are consistent.
  - Point out possible flaws/pitfalls.
  - Try solving with sequent calculus.
  - Try solving with natural deduction.
- Create a skeleton for the project planning.
- Begin writing on the project planning.

## Problems

The main issue we have had so far is putting in the hours we are supposed to, as there has been quite a heavy workload for the IT-students of the team.

Another obstacle we have yet to completely overcome is all of the administrative preparation so that the project can continue on and be documented with less friction.

### Suggested solutions (with reflections)

- The upcoming week has a bit more slack in the other courses, so more time will be prioritised and dedicated to the project. This way, we can get back on the horse och prevent falling further behind.
- A second meeting with the supervisor should be held as soon as possible in order to both discuss our new ideas and also get feedback on our, not yet started, project planning report.
- Finishing all of the administrative preparation that we have noticed we need so far should be added as soon as possible, so that we can leave such unproductive manners behind and focus on the more productive topics of the project.

#### Solution (if chosen)

All three of the above mentioned solutions will be taken into account and hopefully implemented by the end of next week. This way, we will have taken a great step in the right direction for the success of the project.
