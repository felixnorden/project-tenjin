# Diary Week 11

This week, it was slow... This was due to the workload from the course TDA518 being high and inhibiting the work for three of us.

## Work tasks

- Update UML Class diagram for the implementation, and add necessary classes.
- Connect the logic module to a Unity frontend.
- Come to a decision regarding how the frontend design should be implemented. (i.e what program to use, what style, etc.)
- Continue writing on report, with a focus on these chapters:
  - Background
  - Theory
  - Method

### Finished tasks

- Come to a decision regarding how the frontend design should be implemented. (i.e what program to use, what style, etc.) - Flat design
- Continue writing on report, with a focus on these chapters:
  - Background
  - Theory
  - Method

### Unfinished tasks

- Update UML Class diagram for the implementation, and add necessary classes.
- Connect the logic module to a Unity frontend.

## Problems

- We have had a big problem with the Tree Data structure library we chose to use for our proof tree.
- Importing our core project into Unity seems to be more difficult than we first thought.

### Suggested solutions (with reflections)

For the Tree data structure problem:

- Change into our own implementation of a Tree structure in order to tailor the structure to our needs.
- Make use of a list instead to make things simpler.

For the dependency of our core project

- Read through the documentation of Unity to see what is needed for the compilation of a dependency for it to work.

#### Solution (if chosen)

- Make use of list for the moment, and add in tree when we need to. (May mean that we create our own)
- Read through the docs for Unity.
