# Supervision 1

- Background section, may need more examples of the importance of logics and proofs. Also good to give more concrete examples why it's important for the target audience.
- Motivate a bit more on why we chose the specific age range of our audience.
- Motivate where the answers to our questions can be found or how we plan to find the answers by ourselves.
- Minimum requirements for a finished project.
- No Wikipedia references, rather study material.
- Clarify what roles each member has.
- Great language and structure, easy to read.
- Maybe a bit more information about what kind of visualisation we want to produce. An image or a more in-depth description of how the project will look like.
- Maybe talk more about how one can make the game fun.
- How will we try to find out about our problem statements. 
- No need to enumerate only one Appendix!
