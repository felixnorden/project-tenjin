- Third section of purpose needs to be lifted, maybe take during the
  introduction instead. (Funnel structure)
- Expand on introduction. "Funnel structure" - start wide and work downwards,
  narrowing the subject into the actual purpose.
- Separate the purpose and the concrete objectives into a main section and
  a subsection.
- Maybe rethink the title, remove "Tenjin" and have the subtitle as the title,
  with a more descriptive subtitle of what the project/study actually wants to
  achieve.
- Add good search engine keywords.
- Include useful SEO keywords in title as well.
- Add keywords after "Abstract".
- Maybe move some of the more interesting subjects from "Background" to
  "Introduction"
  - Alternatively, remove "Background" chapter and add the relevant contents
    in the introductory paragraphs of "Introduction".
- "Scope and Limitations" could be slimmed down and remove unnecessary
  paragraphs.
- Write with the reader in mind, not the teacher! I.e. only include information
  that the reader could find valuable to the project.
- Try to find some social or ethical value to the project. (E.g.
  Digitalisation, open up for formal logic in less academic setting)
- Split first paragraph of the "Background" and introduce clarifying section.
- Add nuance to the extents of how Logic is taught in Upper secondary school,
  avoid simply "black and white" situations.
- Tables need captions above, figures below.
- Add more descriptive section titles in "Theory" to describe what is brought
  up in the contents.
- Introduction in "Methods" chapter.
- Shift perspective from the team's workflow to more of the necessary methods
  and tools that were applied to reach the results.
- Write more on the user testing group.
- Base the "Discussion" sections on both the results and possibly methods,
  taking into consideration the noted problems/uncertainties/inaccuracies.
- Reference back to "Theory" chapter in "Methods" and "reiterate" upon what has
  been mentioned in "Methods" when presenting the results.
