# Meeting 25-04-19

## Plan for the week (until the 1st of May)

This week we want to have an almost finished version of the report. Some parts of the report may be revised, such as result, discussions and method depending on final state of the application, but everything done on this project up to the 30th of April should be documented.

In unity, if there is time, we want create scripts for reading a level in the core package and create a visual representation of that level in unity. The visual representation should include different visualizations for atomic propositions, split, case and negation according to our chosen visualization.
