# Meeting 08-04-19

## Plan for the week

The plan will look highly similar to last week:

This week, we want to have something that is "playable" to some extent. More concretely, we want to be able to interact with the model through a simple Unity interface.

Once we have something "playable" we also want to update our models to make them reflect the implemented model.

We also want to continue writing on the report to fill in the relevant information of what we have done so far in the project.

Additionally, we plan on maybe also creating our own Tree data structure library in C#.

## Tasks

- Update UML class diagram for the implementation and add necessary classes.
- Connect logic module to Unity frontend.
- Continue writing on report, with the focus on the following chapters:
  - Background
  - Theory
  - Method
  - Result
- Write Tree library

## Problems

Problems from last week's diary (w11).

- We have had a big problem with the Tree Data structure library we chose to use for our proof tree.
- Importing our core project into Unity seems to be more difficult than we first thought.

## Takeaways and goals until next meeting

We will plan on working together as much as possible in order to get things done, as some people are going to be occupied with their other courses quite a bit this week.
