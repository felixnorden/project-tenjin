## Problems

This week, the main problem we have had is the insane amount of work that has been demanded of us in the other courses. Another thing that we are pondering about is what kind of graphics we should use in Unity. We are either looking into "polyart", simple shapes or simple orthographic art.

## Takeaways and goals until next meeting

Thinking about recursive solutions for the visualisation was definitely harder than we first expected, as the different solutions always had edge cases that were breaking the idea completely.
