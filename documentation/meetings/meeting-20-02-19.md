# Meeting 20-02-19

## Plan for the week

### Goals

- Decide on Natural Deduction vs Sequent Calculus
- Refine sprint plan
- Revise Gantt scheme
- Define main concepts of Domain model
- Define the minimal set of operations needed to represent the chosen proof methodology

#### Decide on Natural Deduction vs Sequent Calculus

The group has decided on choosing Sequent Calculus.

#### Refine sprint plan

The plan has been refined and added into the team's Trello.

#### Revise Gantt scheme

Tuyen will upload the Gantt scheme to a common drive so that everybody has access.

#### Define main concepts of Domain model

- Problem
- Proofs
  - Operators
    - Binary
      - Split - âˆ§L and âˆ¨R
      - Cases - âˆ§R and âˆ¨L
    - Unary
      - Negate - Â¬
  - Propositions
  - Hypotheses
  - Conclusions
- Verification
- Levels
- Score
  - Time based
  - Step based
    - Absolute (from 0 steps)
    - Relative (to Optimal solution)
  - Solutions (Overall)
- Player

Definition of Proof: A set of Hypotheses that can be verified to result in the given set of conclusions.

All proofs are problems, but not all problems are proofs.

#### Define the minimal set of operations needed to represent the chosen proof methodology

We have chosen to only use negation, conjunction and disjunction in SC with the names

- "negate"
- "split" - âˆ§L and âˆ¨R
- "cases" - âˆ§R and âˆ¨L
