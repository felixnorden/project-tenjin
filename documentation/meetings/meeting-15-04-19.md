# Meeting 08-04-19

## Plan for the week

The plan will look highly similar to last week:

This week, we want to have something that is "playable" to some extent. More concretely, we want to be able to interact with the model through a simple Unity interface.

Once we have something "playable" we also want to update our models to make them reflect the implemented model.

We also want to continue writing on the report to fill in the relevant information of what we have done so far in the project.

We will expand our assets as well, and refactor our logical game module.

## Tasks

- Update UML class diagram for the implementation and add necessary classes.
- Connect logic module to Unity frontend.
  - Be prepared for errors
- Continue writing on report, with the focus on the following chapters:
  - Background
  - Theory
    - C\#
  - Method
    - Logic Module
  - Result
  - Proof-read report
  - Check out other reports within IT to get a better feeling of how the report should be like
- Add more assets
- Refactor logic module

## Problems

Problems from last week's diary (w12).

- Importing our core project into Unity seems to be more difficult than we first thought.

## Takeaways and goals until next meeting

We will plan on working together as much as possible in order to get things done. We will increase our work hours to complete the tasks.
