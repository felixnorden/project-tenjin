# Meeting 12-02-19

## Plan for the week

- Hours: Everybody will put in more hours this week in order to finish the project planning and to have one of the different visualisation types done.
- Pair/mob work: Have another meeting where everybody works in either pairs or in whole team to continue the work.

### Project planning discussion

- Project planning:
  - Target audience - People from 13 - 25
  - Core to be used for different areas, such as research and development, whilst we will focus on entertainment aspects with an interactive and fun experience.
  - Backend: Specifiy and concretisize the iterative building blocks
    - It 1: Hardcoded and well-defined proofs and a simple prototype.
    - It 2: Specify the complexity of a proof - grade their difficulty. What are the properties that define the difficulty.
    - It 3: From this, generate proofs using a preferred language. (Maybe ask Max from DSLsOfMath?)
  - Frontend:
    - It 1: Research about UX and design in user studies, define what "_intuitive_" means to us. Find 2-3 key aspects from these studies.
    - It 2: Mockups and wire frames for 2, maybe 3, visualisations. Each visualisation should focus on one of the found key aspects found in iteration 1. Test the mockups on friends and random people on campus.
    - It 3: Create and implement the most efficient visualisation.
  - Methods:
    - Scrum/Agile
    - Follow good development practises, such as S.O.L.I.D, DRY, YAGNI...

### Goals

- Hours to dedicate this week
