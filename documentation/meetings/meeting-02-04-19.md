# Meeting 02-04-19

## Plan for the week

This week, we want to have something that is "playable" to some extent. More concretely, we want to be able to interact with the model through a simple Unity interface.

Once we have something "playable" we also want to update our models to make them reflect the implemented model.



We also want to continue writing on the report to fill in the relevant information of what we have done so far in the project.

## Tasks

- Update UML Class diagram for the implementation, and add necessary classes.
- Connect the logic module to a Unity frontend.
- Come to a desicion regarding how the frontend design should be implemented. (i.e what program to use, what style, etc.)
- Continue writing on report, with a focus on these chapters:
  - Background
  - Theory
  - Method


## Task distribution

Most work will be done with the whole group, except for writing the report which will be done by each member on their own depending on how time consuming the rest of task will be. 

## Problems

No problems.

## Takeaways and goals until next meeting
