# Meeting March 26 2019

## Plan for the week

This week, we want to have something that is "playable" to some extent. More concretely, we want to be able to interact with the model through a simple Unity interface.

Additionally, testing of the paper prototype will be done with the testers that are available this week.

We also want to begin writing on the report to fill in the relevant information of what we have done so far in the project.

## Tasks

- Finish the logic module for iteration one (C#).
- Update UML Class diagram for the implementation, and add necessary classes.
- Begin connecting the logic module to a Unity frontend.
- Do as many User tests as possible.
- Begin writing on report
